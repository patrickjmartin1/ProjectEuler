# ProjectEuler
My code for solving Project Euler problems

I have been working my way through the Project Euler (PE) problems for several years now, and have gone long periods of time without working on anything in here. As one would expect, my coding style has changed over time, and now many scripts/code I wrote years ago look quite a bit different than they would if I wrote them from scratch today. I will direct you to the updates section below, and encourage any casual browsers to take a look at the most recently submitted solutions.

Update 7/26/2021:
I am moving my code from the legacy Mercurial (Hg) repository over into git and github.
